7. "A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Haven Junction : (27.6846,-103.3366) ;Maple Meadows Village : (27.6239,-103.3352);North Lake Sanctuary : (27.5037,-103.3091);Rocky Canyon Landing : (27.6314,-103.3025) & Central Command Post Location: (27.6072,-103.2503) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Haven Junction. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance

4801 meters

5804 meters

5189 meters

7150 meters"
